## 🎯 Mission

To democratize AI security by creating an open, educational framework that enables developers to build, evaluate, and secure specialized AI agents from the ground up—applying zero-trust principles to ensure safe collaboration in the emerging agentic AI ecosystem.

## 🚨 Why This Matters

As AI systems evolve from isolated tools to interconnected agents with increasing autonomy, the attack surface expands dramatically. Traditional perimeter-based security fails in this environment. We need **zero-trust architecture designed specifically for AI agents**.

**The Problem:**
- AI agents increasingly communicate through protocols like Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Multi-agent systems create complex trust boundaries
- A compromised agent can affect entire networks of AI services
- Most developers lack security tools tailored to agentic architectures
- Existing zero-trust frameworks weren't designed with AI agents in mind

**The Solution:**
Agent Scrutiny provides the tools, templates, and knowledge to build security into AI systems from their foundation, adhering to the core principle: **never trust, always verify**.

## 🔑 Core Principles

We extend traditional zero-trust principles to the unique challenges of AI agents:

- **Verify every agent interaction** - No implicit trust between agents
- **Assume compromise** - Design systems that remain secure even if individual agents are compromised
- **Least-privilege access** - Agents receive only the minimum permissions needed
- **Continuous monitoring** - Real-time evaluation of agent behavior and communications
- **Context-aware security** - Dynamic policy enforcement based on agent behavior patterns

## 🎓 Educational & Staged Approach

This project follows a **build-in-public, staged methodology** where each stage introduces new security concepts and capabilities:

- **Stage 0**: Foundation - Threat modeling and architecture (Current)
- **Stage 1**: Scrutinizer Core - Basic detection and monitoring
- **Stage 2**: MCP Security & Plugins - Protocol analysis and extensible plugin ecosystem
- **Stage 3**: RAG Integration - Dynamic security policies
- **Stage 4**: Multi-Agent Security - Behavior profiling and anomaly detection
- **Stage 5**: Production Hardening - Enterprise-ready deployment

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for detailed stage breakdowns.

## 🏗️ What We're Building

### Scrutinizer Engine
A security evaluation engine capable of:
- Analyzing agent-to-agent communications
- Detecting prompt injection, data exfiltration, and privilege escalation
- Enforcing zero-trust policies in real-time
- Providing explainable security decisions

### Plugin Architecture
A modular plugin system for domain-specific security:
- Specialized analysis modules loaded on demand
- Community and commercial plugin ecosystem
- Each plugin is an isolated security boundary
- Examples: smart contract security, MCP protocol analysis, compliance checking

### Reusable Templates
Modular, adaptable patterns for:
- Securing specialized AI models with zero-trust controls
- RAG architectures with evolving security policies
- Safe agent collaboration with continuous verification
- Common agentic AI security scenarios

### Educational Resources
Clear documentation that:
- Breaks down complex AI security into manageable concepts
- Provides hands-on examples and working code
- Bridges security expertise and AI development skills
- Makes AI security accessible to all developers

## 🚀 Quick Start

> **Note**: We're currently in Stage 0 (Foundation). Code examples will be available starting in Stage 1.

### Current Stage: Documentation & Planning

1. **Review the threat model**: See `docs/THREAT-MODEL.md`
2. **Understand the architecture**: See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. **Learn zero-trust for AI**: See `docs/ZERO-TRUST-PRINCIPLES.md`
4. **Check the roadmap**: See `ROADMAP.md`

### Coming in Stage 1

```python
from agent_scrutiny import Scrutinizer

# Initialize Scrutinizer with security policies
scrutinizer = Scrutinizer(
    policies=["prompt-injection", "data-exfiltration"],
    mode="strict"
)

# Evaluate agent interaction
result = scrutinizer.evaluate(
    agent_input="User message here",
    agent_output="Agent response here",
    context={"agent_id": "assistant-1"}
)

if result.is_safe:
    print("✓ Interaction verified")
else:
    print(f"⚠ Security violation: {result.threat_type}")
```

### Plugin Example (Stage 2+)

```python
from agent_scrutiny import Scrutinizer
from agent_scrutiny.plugins import SmartContractPlugin

scrutinizer = Scrutinizer(policies=["prompt-injection"])

# Load domain-specific plugin
scrutinizer.load_plugin(
    SmartContractPlugin(
        chains=["ethereum", "polygon"],
        value_limits={"eth": 1.0}
    )
)

# Scrutinizer now understands smart contract context
result = scrutinizer.evaluate(
    agent_input="Transfer 100 ETH to 0x...",
    agent_output="Initiating transfer...",
    context={"type": "smart_contract_interaction", "chain": "ethereum"}
)
```
